This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

Technologies used in the Project:
Axios: To load the json file.
React-saga: To assist in asynchronous loading of json.
Redux: To to create store and hold the json data in two different array (Movielist and Serieslist) after the arrays are sorted.
React-router: To navigate between pages.
react-spinkit: A set of spinners to show image loading animation.
Conditional.js: A very usefull function to conditionally render components.
react-loading-image: a useful component which shows error if the image is not loaded and shows a spinner while the image is loaded.
SASS: for css compilation.
Enzyme: for run shallow test and mount tests
Jest: Testing engine to run tests.
There are two TTD tests written for this course. 1 for the json_reducer and the 2nd for the tilebutton js

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes Definitely there is very much scope for improvements..
Would implement Lazy loading of images in mobile as user scrolls the images would then load..
Would fade-in Fade out as when when users Navigate between pages... to give a nice transition.
Would Include velocity animations so the tiles appear with some animation to screen.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I would definitely work on the improvements listed above, If I had  given more time.
Also I would have tried to provide users the option to adjust filters, So their would be some changes hapening on the tiles and we could get to do some activities on Movie list and Series list screen.

Please Note: The build files are in the build folder and I have put up this module on Firebase..
